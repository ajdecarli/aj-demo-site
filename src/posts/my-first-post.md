Before I equip you with the steps of a potent debt reduction strategy - **The Debt Tsunami** - I want to share an ancient Proverb with you.

> The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is slave to the lender.

When I first came across this ancient wisdom, I just so happened to be drowning in debt. I guess you can say it struck the *proverbial* cord. 

The second half — "the borrower is a slave to the lender" — rattled me at my core. This age-old insight perfectly captured how I felt — like a slave to creditors. I hustled every day to earn money to pay Sallie Mae, Chase Auto Finance, American Express, or anyone else willing to lend me money at the time. It was an infuriating grind that resulted in little financial progress.

Sometimes I felt guilty because my debt blocked me from providing memorable experiences for my family. Sometimes I felt ashamed that I was irresponsible enough to accumulate debt. But, most of all, I felt trapped.

The **$38k** of debt (8 student loans, 1 auto loan, and 2 credit cards) I amassed crowded my mental space, and It stopped me from showing up fully in all areas of my life. **This debt was toxic baggage from my past** **that acted as a ball and chain.** 

**Fun Fact:** According to [Debt.org](http://Debt.org), Millennials (ages 24 to 39) have on average $87,448 of debt. So, if you have toxic, joy-sucking financial obligations and want to eliminate them, you're not alone.

Thankfully, advice for paying off debt is ubiquitous these days. It only took an hour to pinpoint a solution online and formulate a debt pay-off crusade. After researching the Debt-Snowball and Avalanche debt reduction strategies, I settled on a modified Debt-Snowball approach.

Subsequently, I discovered my modified Debt Snowball strategy was dubbed the Debt-Tsunami by Adam Baker. 

## What is the Debt Tsunami?

The Debt Tsunami is a debt pay-off strategy in which you tackle debts in order of their emotional impact. This strategy is simple, but it makes perfect sense. Rather than remove emotions from the process, why not leverage them to supercharge your debt-free crusade?

## Steps To Implement to Debt Tsunami

### **1. Grab a pen and piece of paper; you will create a handwritten plan of attack.**

Why write it down on paper? For a couple of reasons. First, when you create a visceral connection with your Plan of Attack, you increase your odds of sticking to it. Second, you will place the plan in a location that is easy to access and review at any time (i.e., Your refrigerator). This handwritten plan will be a constant reminder of what you're doing and why you're doing it.

### **2. List all of your debts from smallest to largest** **outstanding balance.**

Like the Debt-Snowball, you start by listing all of your debts in order from smallest to largest outstanding balance. Make sure to include the following columns for each debt: Lender, Outstanding Balance, Minimum Payment, Emotional Weight, and Notes. Leave the Emotional Weight and Notes columns blank for now.

You will have a table similar to this.

### **3. Assign an Emotional Weight Score to your debts.**

Okay, here is where the magic of the Debt Tsunami happens. It's time to uncover any negative emotions associated with your debt. Take a moment to evaluate each debt for emotional baggage. Then, assign a number between 0 and 5 and add a note summarizing its impact. The higher the number, the more emotional weight is associated with the debt.

For example, if you owe your best friend Judy $2,500 and this transaction has strained your friendship, you might assign an Emotional Weight Score of 4. 

Some debts may not have any noteworthy negatively charged emotions associated with them. That's alright. If the item has zero emotional impact, enter 0 and move on to the next debt. 

### **4. Rearrange your debts based on emotional weight.**

The items with the most significant emotional impact will move up in the list, and debts with less impact will stay the same or move down the list. Once you have rearranged the items, you will have an official Plan of Attack. Congrats!

### **5. Place your Plan of Attack in a location that can be easily revisited.**

Some good places to post your Plan of Attack are the kitchen fridge (especially if you're a foody like me), your bathroom mirror, or the side of your computer monitor. Please don't overthink this one, and place it somewhere you are likely to see daily.

### **6. Roll up your sleeves and get to work.**

Now that you have a plan, it's time to execute. Here's how you need to move forward. 

* Pay the minimum payments on all debts except for the first item on the list. 
* Make extra payments on the debt at the top of the list. 
* Once you have paid off a debt, cross it off, celebrate, and roll the minimum payment for that debt into the next item on the list. (Rolling the minimum payment into the next debt creates a snowball effect. As you move down the list by paying off debts, your Debt Snowball will grow, then eventually morph into a Debt Tsunami, and the outstanding debt balance will shrink at a rapid rate.)
* Repeat the process until you've wiped out all debts. 

## **Increase Your Odds of Success**

Here are some additional tips and resources you can use to increase your odds of becoming debt-free.

### Tip 1: Know Why You Are Paying Off Debt In The First Place

When you commit to something (i.e., aggressively paying off debt), you inherently give up the opportunity to do something else (i.e., buying a new Tesla Model S on credit). This trade-off is commonly known as opportunity cost.

> You can experience or buy something but not everything. 

As you start your journey, you will come out of the gates with a vengeance. You're going to be slashing monthly expenses, earning money on the side, selling things you don't need for cash, and so on. This effort is excellent, and the initial momentum will have you crushing debt.

But, eventually, you will hit a slump. Then, you're going to encounter a situation that tests your resolve - should you stay the course or prolong the trip with a detour? Maybe your old friend from college invites you on an expensive trip to travel through Europe for a month. What should you do?

You should determine the actual cost of the trip and decide if taking the trip is in line with your why. How much time will be added to your debt-free journey if you take the trip? 2 weeks? 2 months? 6 months? 

My wife and I wanted to become debt-free before our daughter was born. We knew that having debt would make it harder for us to provide for her, and having debt would also reduce the amount of time we could step away from work once she was born. So, our "why" temporarily trumped most experiences or luxuries.  

### **Tip 2: Celebrate Each Time You Pay Off a Debt**

On your debt-free journey, make sure to recognize and celebrate each debt pay-off victory regardless of size. Remember, you set out to accomplish something, and you did it. 

My wife and I treated ourselves to a date night every time we scratched a debt off the list, and it was a blast. Our celebrations helped us remain present during the process and revitalized our motivation for the next round. 

### **Tip 3: Use Sucess Stories As Motivation**

One thing I found to be particularly useful as my wife and I tackled debt was reading and watching success stories of people who paid off huge debts before me. Watching these testimonials reminds you that accomplishing your goal is possible and will spark competitiveness.

It will also motivate you to look for other ways to accelerate the process. There are plenty of examples on the internet of people becoming debt-free. 

I found the examples above on Instagram by searching [\#debtfreescream](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/debtfreescream/). 

### **Tip 4: Track your progress visually** 

If you want to add a little fun to your debt-free journey use, [this chart](https://debtfreecharts.com/collections/top-5-charts/products/debt-free-land) to track your progress. As you reduce your outstanding balance, you color the blocks on the chart. You might feel that you're not making progress during your journey, but this chart will remind you that you are. Give it a try.
